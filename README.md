# CIS194: Introduction to Haskell

This repository hosts my solutions to the [CIS194(Spring 2013) course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) of 
University of Pennsylvania.

## Environment setup

If you have issues in setting up a working Haskell development environment with syntax check and autocompletion, 
see [this repository](https://github.com/BoeingX/docker-haskell-vim) for an example of using Vim 8.0 and
[Haskell IDE Engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine).

## Todo

- [ ] Refactor the repository with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- [ ] Add unit tests
