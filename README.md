# CS194: Introduction to Haskell

This repository hosts my solutions to the [CS194(Spring 2013) course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) of 
University of Pennsylvania.

## Environment setup

Vim8.0 and GHC-mod is used throughout this repository. 
See [this post](http://boeingx.github.io/posts/vim/interactively-run-code-with-vim-8.0/) 
for instructions for setting up a docker-based environment.
